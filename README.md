This repository showcases a **multi-agent airline customer support voice agent** built with OpenAI Agents SDK, FastAPI, and Next.js.

The app simulates an airline's customer support system, where a primary assistant routes user requests to specialized agents for flights, hotels, car rentals, and excursions. Users interact via natural voice conversations, and the system supports multi-turn dialog, handoffs, and real-time responses.

**Features:**

- Multi-agent orchestration for airline support (flights, hotels, car rentals, excursions)
- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Push-to-talk audio mode
- Function calling and tool use
- Streaming responses

**Example use cases:**

- Book, update, or cancel a flight
- Reserve or modify a hotel or car rental
- Get trip recommendations or book excursions
- Ask about airline policies
